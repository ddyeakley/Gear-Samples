## Standalone Samples

These are public samples for the Gear 2 and Gear S. These samples operate on the watch, without
interaction from a phone, once they are installed. 

To use the samples, import the contents of the 'project' folder within each sample into your Eclipse workspace.

There is a separate README in each top-level sample folder, describing the purpose of the sample.

## Templates

These templates are part of the Tizen SDK for Wearable and are used as the start
of new projects for Gear devices. They are minimal samples with a working
structure, but little in the way of example code.

## Companion Samples

These samples demonstrate the communication between the Gear watch and a Samsung mobile phone using
Rich Notifications and/or the Samsung Accessory Protocol (SAP).
