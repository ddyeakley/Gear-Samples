# Gear Samples

These are public samples for the Gear 2 and Gear S. Some of these are available in the Tizen SDK for Wearable in the 

<pre>
~/tizen-wearable-sdk/platforms/tizenw-1.0/samples/web/Sample/Tizen/Web App
</pre>

To use the samples, import the contents of the 'project' folder within each
sample into your Eclipse workspace.

There is a separate README in each top-level sample folder, describing the
purpose of the sample.

# Gear Templates

These templates are part of the Tizen SDK for Wearable and are used as the start
of new projects for Gear devices. They are minimal samples with a working
structure, but little in the way of example code.
