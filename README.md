There is a separate README in each top-level sample folder, describing the
purpose of the sample.

## IDE Templates

These templates are part of the Tizen SDK for Wearable and are used as the start
of new projects for Gear devices. They are minimal samples with a working
structure, but little in the way of example code.

## SDC Samples

These samples are written by members of the Samsung Developer Connection Github organization or 
others contributing samples. They are not part of the official Tizen SDK. The samples may show
as specific purpose or integration with a third-party application or service.
