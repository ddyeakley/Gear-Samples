## Standalone Samples

These are public samples for the Gear 2 and Gear S. These samples operate on the watch, without
interaction from a phone, once they are installed. 

To use the samples, import the contents of the 'project' folder within each sample into your Eclipse workspace.

There is a separate README in each top-level sample folder, describing the purpose of the sample.
